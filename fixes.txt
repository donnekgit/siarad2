CHANGES IN SIARAD2
===================


Header corrections
-----------------------

Change headers to reflect new marking. = DONE


Main tier corrections
--------------------------

Remove incorrectly-introduced linebreak+tab (eg davies13, 729, 749). = DONE

Replace "o't ti" by "o(edde)t ti", "o'n i" by "o(eddw)n i", "o'ch chi" by "o(edde)ch chi" and "o'n ni" by "o(edde)n ni". 
Likewise for negative forms, eg do't ti --> d(oedde)t ti.

Make corrections thrown up by the wedi examples (KD email of 4 August 2013 ff).  Includes: Replace PRT.PAST by PRT.PERF; PERF also needs adding in conventions file.

Replace "yeah@s:cym" by "yeah@s:cym&eng". = DONE

Replace "t/drwadd" by "t/drwodd". = DONE

Convert xx to xxx

Replace "..." quotation marks in main tier by <...> ["] - OR IS IT ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY ROUND? JUST DOWNLOADED THE CHAT MANUAL AND FOUND THE "..." QUOTATION MARKS IN THERE!  -- KD to check with BM what the current marking is.

Replace "nag" by "nac" in tags (only "nac ydy" is on Patagonia changes list)

Replace "wan" (now) by "(r)wan". = DONE

Replace "tax@s:cym&eng" by "tax@s:eng". = DONE

Replace "uh_huh@s:cym&eng" by "uhuh@s:eng" in line with IM list.

Replace "de" by "(yn)de", and also "te" by "(yn)te" -- needs manual checking. :-(

? Check for unmotivated colons in main tier (e.g. fusser22) - can that be done automatically?

Remove underlines from numerals (numerals.txt).

Change spwnjo -> spynjo in fusser30. = DONE


Other tier corrections
---------------------------

Where changes have been made to xx/xxx on the main tier, sometimes the manual gloss doesn't match now. Can this be fixed by a programme?

Get rid of caps at beginning of %eng (unless proper name)?  eg in davies2

Stammers3 line 68 has 'poss.2S' in the gls tier instead of 'POSS.2S'.


Glossary
-----------

? Add "elwch" 'merriment' to autoglosser dictionary - or change gloss for davies9, 379 manually?

In write_cgautogloss.php, add code to convert spaces to underscores, so that "this year.ADV" is written "this_year.ADV". Also "throw_a_tantrum".


Welsh constraint grammar rules
---------------------------------------

Use lawr (adv) instead of llawr (n) everywhere except after ar (prep)

Change ei to MF, and add rule to choose M if (f)o/e follows, F if hi follows, M if SM follows.


English constraint grammar rules
-----------------------------------------

(Test the English CG by extracting all the English utterances, and running it against them)

Where you have a "_o" ending, SV gets converted to V (eg swim_o)

AS+PV will collapse to N.PL when followed by "yn"


Packaging
-------------

Run Chatter

Change language tags in the files for Talkbank: @s:eng => @s; @s@cym&eng => @s:und

Make sure the abbreviations in the manual gloss match those in the autogloss and the abbreviations list in the doc file
