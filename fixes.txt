In write_cgautogloss.php, add code to convert spaces to underscores, so that "this year.ADV" is written "this_year.ADV". Also "throw_a_tantrum".

Main tier: systematically replace "o't ti" by "o(edde)t ti", "o'n i" by "o(eddw)n i", "o'ch chi" by "o(edde)ch chi" and "o'n ni" by "o(edde)n ni".

Manual gloss: systematically replace PRT.PAST by PRT.PERF; PERF also needs adding in conventions file.

? Add "elwch" 'merriment' to autoglosser dictionary - or change gloss for davies9, 379 manually?

Where changes have been made to xx/xxx on the main tier, sometimes the manual gloss doesn't match now. Can this be fixed by a programme?

Get rid of caps at beginning of %eng (unless proper name)?  eg in davies2

Add grammar rule to use lawr (adv) instead of llawr (n) everywhere except after ar (prep)

Run Chatter

Systematically replace "yeah@s:cym" by "yeah@s:cym&eng"

?? Systematically replace "..." quotation marks in main tier by <...> ["] - OR IS IT ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY ROUND? JUST DOWNLOADED THE CHAT MANUAL AND FOUND THE "..." QUOTATION MARKS IN THERE!

? Check for unmotivated colons in main tier (e.g. fusser22) - can that be done automatically?

Replace "nag" by "nac" in tags (only "nac ydy" is on Patagonia changes list)

? Replace "wan" 'now' by "ŵan" (probably a manual job...)

Replace any instances of "tax@s:cym&eng" by "tax@s:eng"

Replace "uh_huh@s:cym&eng" by "uhuh@s:eng" in line with IM list

Make sure the abbreviations in the manual gloss match those in the autogloss and the abbreviations list in the doc file

Change language tags in the files for Talkbank: @s:eng => @s; @s@cym&eng => @s:und

Systematically replace "trwadd" by "trwodd" and "drwadd" by "drwodd"
