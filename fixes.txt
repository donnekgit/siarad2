In write_cgautogloss.php, add code to convert spaces to underscores, so that "this year.ADV" is written "this_year.ADV". Also "throw_a_tantrum".

Main tier: systematically replace "o't ti" by "o(edde)t ti", "o'n i" by "o(eddw)n i" and "o'n ni" by "o(edde)n ni".

Manual gloss: systematically replace PRT.PAST by PRT.PERF; PERF also needs adding in conventions file.

? Add "elwch" 'merriment' to autoglosser dictionary - or change gloss for davies9, 379 manually?

Where changes have been made to xx/xxx on the main tier, sometimes the manual gloss doesn't match now. Can this be fixed by a programme?
