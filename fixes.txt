Make corrections thrown up by the wedi examples (KD email of 4 August 2013 ff).  Includes: Replace PRT.PAST by PRT.PERF; PERF also needs adding in conventions file.

Replace "..." quotation marks in main tier by <...> ["] - OR IS IT ACTUALLY THE OTHER WAY ROUND? JUST DOWNLOADED THE CHAT MANUAL AND FOUND THE "..." QUOTATION MARKS IN THERE!  -- KD to check with BM what the current marking is.

Replace "nag" by "nac" in tags (only "nac ydy" is on Patagonia changes list).

Replace "de" by "(yn)de", and also "te" by "(yn)te" -- needs manual checking. :-(

? Check for unmotivated colons in main tier (e.g. fusser22) - can that be done automatically?

Remove underlines from numerals (numerals.txt).


Other tier corrections
---------------------------

Where changes have been made to xx/xxx on the main tier, sometimes the manual gloss doesn't match now. Can this be fixed by a programme? = DONE

Get rid of caps at beginning of %eng (unless proper name) in davies2 and fusser6. = DONE

Stammers3 line 68 has 'poss.2S' in the gls tier instead of 'POSS.2S'. = DONE


Glossary
-----------

? Add "elwch" 'merriment' to autoglosser dictionary - or change gloss for davies9, 379 manually?

In write_cgautogloss.php, add code to convert spaces to underscores, so that "this year.ADV" is written "this_year.ADV". Also "throw_a_tantrum".


Welsh constraint grammar rules
---------------------------------------

Use lawr (adv) instead of llawr (n) everywhere except after ar (prep)

Change ei to MF, and add rule to choose M if (f)o/e follows, F if hi follows, M if SM follows.


English constraint grammar rules
-----------------------------------------

(Test the English CG by extracting all the English utterances, and running it against them)

Where you have a "_o" ending, SV gets converted to V (eg swim_o)

AS+PV will collapse to N.PL when followed by "yn"
