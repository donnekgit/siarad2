Siarad Welsh-English bilingual corpus, second edition
========================================================

This directory contains a Git version control repository for the second edition of the Siarad Corpus.

The first edition was published in 2009 by the then ESRC Centre for Research on Bilingualism in Theory and Practice, Bangor University, Wales (http://bilingualism.bangor.ac.uk).

Note that this directory is NOT the published version, which is available from http://bangortalk.org.uk.

The beta folder contains the corrected files from Siarad1, along with subsequent emendations.

The autoglossed folder will contain the files with a gloss added by the Bangor Autoglosser (http://bangortalk.org.uk/autoglosser.php), with typeset versions in the pdf subfolder.

The corpus files (recordings and transcriptions) are copyright the ESRC Centre, 2012-5, and are released under the GPLv3 or later (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

Linguistic or methodological queries should be addressed to Margaret Deuchar (m.deuchar@gmail.com).

Technical queries should be addressed to Kevin Donnelly (donnekgit).
